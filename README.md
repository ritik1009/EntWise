# EntWise a Movie review website

In this project I have created a website where the user can get the details of the movie, they can write a review about the movie and for writing a review you need to sign up and then login into the account. 

In this project I have used Googles firebase as my database where I am storeing the movies and all the data. If you wnat to clone it you need to craete a firebase project and then you need to link it. And then store the firebase credentials in the .env folder.
